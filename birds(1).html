<h1>PEPPER</h1>
<b><p style="font-size:35px;background-color:#666699;">Pepper is the male bird and he loves to fly around alot.He usually goes out but also comes back at the same time you don't have to worry that he would fly somewhere and will never return again 
We should not forget that afterall birds are the free spirit and they don't like to stay at a same place.So if you appriciate there freedom then pepper is the best option.
You would not have to do much for him which means anyone in your house can take care of him.
